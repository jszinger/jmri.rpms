RPM Packaging of JMRI

Targets Fedora 27/28.

Each package is in its own directory with an RPM build hierarchy.

Highly experimental and currently broken
    Should compile and pass most unit tests.

spectool -g to download the SOURCES
    spectool -g -C ../SOURCES/ usb4java.spec 

get all SOURCES
$ for d in *;do pushd $d/SPECS; spectool -g -C ../SOURCES/ *.spec; popd ;done


rpmbuild -bs to create src.rpms
    rpmbuild -D'_topdir ..' -bs usb4java.spec 

build all SRPMS
$ for d in *;do pushd $d/SPECS; rpmbuild -D'_topdir ..' -bs *.spec; popd ;done


mockchain to build everything
$ mockchain -r fedora-27-x86_64 -l /usr/local/mockchain/ --recurse */SRPMS/*.src.rpm
$ mockchain -r fedora-28-x86_64 -l /usr/local/mockchain/ --recurse */SRPMS/*.src.rpm

The JMRI unit tests are flakey.

Jython is completely not functional.
